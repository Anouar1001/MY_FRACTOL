Fractol is a cool little project I built in C using the MiniLibX library to explore the beauty of fractals. It lets you generate and interact with three famous fractals: the Mandelbrot Set, Julia Set, and Tricorn. You can zoom in, pan around, and even play with colors to see these fractals in different ways. It’s like a mini math-art playground!

What’s Inside:

Mandelbrot Set: The classic fractal everyone loves, with its endless swirls and patterns.

Julia Set: A fractal that changes as you tweak its parameters—super fun to experiment with.

Tricorn: A lesser-known but super cool fractal with a unique, symmetrical look.

Zoom in and out to explore the tiny details or see the big picture.

Change colors to make the fractals look however you like.

Everything runs smoothly thanks to C and MiniLibX.
